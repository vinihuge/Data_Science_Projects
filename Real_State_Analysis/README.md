> Conclusion

This is a study of the house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. 

The EDA comproved that the best houses to sell are the ones with 3 and 4 bedroom, these are the ones with the best liquidity. The Machine Learning Model still have a MAPE(Mean Absolute Percentual Error) of 13.61% in the precification, so a good practice should be buy properties with at least this percentage of discount to have a security marge. 

Another finding was that the best months for sale are between April and July, with the highest prices and the highest amount of sales. While between october and february are the best months to buy propertys with low prices, taking advantage of the market promotions.

The company should take adventagy of the increase of the houses prices building more bedrooms, principaly from 1 to 2 bedrooms and 3 to 4 bedrooms were the addiction of only 1 bedroom increase the mean property price in 25% and 33% respectvely. The propertys of the most sales are the ones with 2 and 3 bedrooms. Even do the increase of 3 to 4 bedrooms is significantly, the company should take care because the liquidy of houses with 4 bedrooms are much worst then the ones with 3 bedrooms, but taking attention to these dettails this still is a good strategy to bigger profits. Even do the price continuos to increase with more bedrooms, starting from 5 bedrooms the amount of houses that are sales is to little and the risk of keeping the property for too long get bigger, so the manager should be careful.
